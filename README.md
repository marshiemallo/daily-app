# Daily App

A Flutter project made for ICS26011 - Mobile Programming.

Daily App is designed to help you organize your life by combining a personal journal with a smart, adaptable to-do list. It ensures you never lose track of habits, chores, or future obligations.

## ✨ Key Features

### ✍️ Daily Journaling
A dedicated space to record your thoughts, reflections, and events of the day. Every entry is automatically saved and linked to its specific date, creating a permanent record of your personal history.

### ✅ Smart To-Do List
Manage your tasks with a system that understands how different responsibilities work:
*   **Permanent Tasks:** Ideal for daily habits (e.g., "Draw for 30 minutes", "Exercise"). These reset automatically every day, so you don't have to re-enter them.
*   **Scheduled Tasks:** Perfect for deadlines or short-term goals. These tasks persist on your daily list until their set completion date, ensuring they stay top-of-mind until finished.

### 🗓️ Calendar
Review your productivity and memories with the integrated Calendar view.
*   **Past Entries:** Tap any previous date to instantly view the journal entry written on that day.
*   **Task History:** Check exactly which tasks you completed (or missed) on any specific date in the past.
